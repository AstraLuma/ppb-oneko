Neko PPB Asset Pack
===================

This is the neko asset pack for [PursuedPyBear](https://pursuedpybear.org/),
which derives its images from the `oneko` command commonly found on Linux systems.

These are 32px images of:

* Two cats, `neko` and `tora` (same but with stripes)
* A `dog`
* Two girls `sakura` and `tomoyo`
* The `bsd` demon

The all have the same images, including a collection of 2-frame animations.

TODO: More utilities, actually document the assets.
